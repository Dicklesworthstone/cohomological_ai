# Cohomological Transformer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. OVERVIEW & CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to **cohomological_transformer**, a single-file Python codebase that explores advanced—and quite speculative—ideas at the intersection of:

- **Deep Neural Networks**  
- **Algebraic Topology** (particularly cohomology, exact sequences, and spectral sequences)
- **Transformer Architectures** (with attention-based processing)
- **Novel Loss Functions & Training Objectives** (to enforce “exactness” or “local-to-global” constraints)
- **Circuit Detection & Pruning** (inspired by sheaf cohomology analogies)

This project combines numerous code snippets from prior research interactions, providing a single-file library that demonstrates how one might incorporate the language and structure of algebraic topology—particularly **exact sequences** and **spectral sequences**—into the design of neural architectures and their training objectives.

### 1.1 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is for **experimental** usage. The code is not guaranteed to produce better results than standard Transformers; rather, it’s a kind of conceptual playground for those curious about:

1. Whether advanced mathematics—like **cohomology**—can inspire new ways to track or constrain feature representations in a neural network  
2. How one might systematically incorporate ideas like “exactness,” “kernel→image sequences,” or “local-to-global spectral sequences” into the forward pass, the loss, and the optimizer  
3. Potential architectural motifs that blend **local** processing with **global** multi-head attention in a “topologically aware” manner  
4. Potential strategies for detecting “critical circuits” in a large model and pruning unimportant weights, with a topological or cohomological rationale  

### 1.2 Why Is This Interesting?

**Cohomology** is a powerful branch of mathematics often used to study global properties of spaces by analyzing local data that “glues together.” In the neural network domain, we frequently face a tension between **local** feature extraction (e.g. convolution or local attention) and **global** representation (e.g. full-attention over the entire input). The **spectral sequence** approach in algebraic geometry or algebraic topology provides a systematic way of “building up” from local data to global invariants.

- In a typical neural net, we rely on multiple layers to create hierarchical representations, from “low-level” features to “high-level” abstract concepts.  
- The **spectral sequence** viewpoint suggests a refined notion of “stages” (or pages) in which local cochains or partial computations get successively aggregated into global cochains.  
- The **exact sequence** viewpoint suggests that certain sub-modules or weight sets must preserve the property that `im(d_n) ⊆ ker(d_{n+1})`, which, in looser terms, might correspond to not “losing” or “contradicting” information in the transitions between layers.

By building code that attempts to mimic these mathematical structures:

- We might discover new ways to **regularize** or **penalize** a network for “collapsing” important information too early (violations of exactness).  
- We might experiment with new training objectives or architecture designs that better handle compositional reasoning or multi-step inference.

### 1.3 What Does It Do Differently Compared to Other Approaches?

Unlike standard Transformers:

- We define specialized **attention layers** (`ExactSequenceAttention`) that incorporate checks for kernel-image alignment, effectively mixing normal attention with a “cohomological gating” factor.  
- We propose **ExactSequenceLoss** and **SpectralSequenceLoss** modules that penalize certain forms of “structural violation” across consecutive layers or local–global pairs.  
- We incorporate trivial “circuit detection” logic (with a norm-based heuristic) and a pruning mechanism that can zero out parameters considered “unimportant.”  
- We unify it all into **one file** so that advanced users can see how everything fits together.  

### 1.4 High-Level Architecture & Advanced Math Inspiration

We draw heavily on:

- **Exact Sequences**: Sequences of groups \( G_0 \to G_1 \to G_2 \to \dots \) where the image of each map is the kernel of the next. This influences the notion that each layer’s transformation should “respect” or preserve crucial sub-representations.  
- **Spectral Sequences**: Tools in algebraic topology that compute cohomology by staged local-to-global assembly. We mimic this with “LocalGlobalBlock” (local conv + global attention) and “SpectralSequenceLayer,” which tries to track partial transformations at multiple “pages.”  
- **Homological Algebra**: The idea of “kernel” and “image” being carefully balanced resonates with the concept of “no information is lost or duplicated incorrectly” from one layer to the next.  
- **Circuit Detection**: We heuristically identify strongly activated sub-networks or parameters and preserve them, while pruning the rest. The intuition is reminiscent of “coherently gluing local data” so the global structure remains correct.

### 1.5 Repository Layout (Even Though It’s a Single File)

Normally, we might split this code into multiple modules or directories:

- `cohomology_core/` with submodules for exact sequences, spectral sequences, etc.  
- `losses/` for custom losses  
- `pruning/` for circuit detection and pruning  
- `optim/` for specialized optimizers  
- `demo/` for example scripts  

But here, **everything** is consolidated into **`cohomological_transformer.py`** for convenience, so you can simply run or import from one place.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. FEATURES & COMPONENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a detailed breakdown of the **major** classes, methods, or sections in `cohomological_transformer.py`:

1. **Exact Sequence Tools**  
   - `ExactSequenceAttention`: A custom multi-head attention that calculates an additional “cohomology-based” score to merge with normal attention.  
   - `ExactSequenceLoss`: Penalizes the product \(\|H_{i+1} * H_i^T\|\) across layer outputs, as a toy measure of “exactness violation.”  
   - `ExactSequencePreservingTransition`, `SequenceTracker`, and `ExactSequenceCell`: More specialized modules that try to preserve subrepresentations across transformations.  

2. **Spectral Sequence Tools**  
   - `LocalAttention`, `LocalGlobalBlock`, `SpectralSequenceLayer`: Attempt to incorporate local processing vs. global attention in a staged manner, reminiscent of building from local cochains to global cochains.  
   - `SpectralSequenceLoss`: Minimizes mismatch between local and global representations.  

3. **Circuit Detection & Pruning**  
   - `CriticalSequenceDetector`: A trivial approach that checks the norm of an activation and flags it if above a threshold.  
   - `CircuitPreservationPruner`: Gathers parameter norms, prunes them if below a certain percentile.  

4. **CohomologicalTrainingObjective**  
   - Combines base task loss with the above structural losses (ExactSequenceLoss and SpectralSequenceLoss).  

5. **Optimizers**  
   - `ExactSequenceOptimizer`: A subclass of `torch.optim.Adam` that stands in for a potential advanced approach, though currently it mostly calls the base Adam.  
   - Others included for demonstration but not necessarily invoked in the final demo.  

6. **Example Models**  
   - `ToyCohomologicalModel`: A minimal model that uses `ExactSequenceAttention` and a `LocalGlobalBlock` to produce classification logits.  
   - `CohomologicalTransformer`: A bigger architecture with H0/H1/H2 levels, trackers, transitions, etc.  

7. **Demo Functions**  
   - A `main_demo()` that spawns the toy model, generates random data, runs a few steps of training, and prints logs.  

In principle, you could pick and choose from these classes to build your own custom architecture. The code is somewhat raw and experimental, so you may need to adapt method signatures or shapes to your own tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. USAGE & EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1 Basic Usage

**Option A**: Run `cohomological_transformer.py` directly to execute the built-in `main_demo()` function. This will:

1. Construct a `ToyCohomologicalModel`  
2. Generate a random batch of data and labels  
3. Create a `CohomologicalTrainingObjective`  
4. Train for a few steps, printing logs  

**Option B**: Import the classes into your own code:

```python
from cohomological_transformer import (
    ToyCohomologicalModel,
    CohomologicalTrainingObjective,
    ExactSequenceOptimizer
)

import torch

model = ToyCohomologicalModel(dim=32, num_classes=5)
objective = CohomologicalTrainingObjective(exact_loss_weight=0.01, spectral_loss_weight=0.01)
optimizer = ExactSequenceOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Some random example data
B, N, D = 8, 10, 32
x = torch.randn(B, N, D)
y = torch.randint(0, 5, size=(B,))

for step in range(5):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(x)
    base_loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(outputs['logits'], y)
    total_loss, logs = objective(outputs, base_loss)
    total_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Step {step}, final_total_loss={logs['final_total_loss']}")
```

### 4.2 Integrating Custom Data & Tasks

- Replace the random data with your dataset. For text tasks, you’d feed token embeddings or a tokenized input; for images, you might adopt a patch-based approach or encode features before passing them in.  
- The code includes a mention of `CohomologicalTransformer` with an embedding layer for token IDs. You can adapt it for any vocabulary or sequence length you want.  
- The specialized modules (`ExactSequenceAttention`, `LocalGlobalBlock`, etc.) are fairly shape-agnostic, but you need to ensure the input dimension `dim` remains consistent across layers.  

### 4.3 Extending or Modifying

Feel free to:

- Combine **Local** + **Global** in more interesting ways. Perhaps you do multiple passes through local–global blocks, or you scale up the dimension.  
- Tweak `ExactSequenceLoss` logic to measure exactness in a different way.  
- Introduce your own gating or “circuit detection” approach if you have domain knowledge about which features are crucial to preserve.

5. ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project draws on concepts from **cohomology**:

1. **Exact Sequence**:  
   > A sequence of modules \( ... \to A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \to ... \) is exact if `im(f) = ker(g)`.  
   In neural terms, one might interpret that a layer’s output subspace (image) should align with the next layer’s “expected input subspace” (kernel). If they don’t, we say “information is lost or a mismatch occurs.”  

2. **Spectral Sequence**:  
   > A process for computing (co)homology in “pages,” gradually refining partial information about local patches into global invariants.  
   We mimic “pages” with layered approaches that unify local features (like small receptive fields or local attention) into global features (like cross-attention or deeper transformations). The hope is to systematically maintain the partial “cochains” so that the final representation is consistent and robust.  

3. **Sheaf Theory, Sheaf Cohomology** (mentioned in earlier theoretical texts):  
   We do not fully implement sheaf cohomology here, but the conversation around “local data gluing to global data” is conceptually aligned with how you might handle multiple “cover elements” in a topological space.  

### 5.1 Potential Architectural Insights

- Sometimes, a model might spontaneously discover “circuits” that correspond to advanced reasoning or consistent patterns across tasks. A cohomological perspective might help systematically identify or preserve those circuits, ensuring they remain “exact.”  
- In large-scale Transformers, attention heads are known to develop specialized roles. A “spectral” viewpoint might group heads at each “page,” analyzing how local attention or global attention evolves.  

### 5.2 Training & Overfitting Considerations

- **Exactness** constraints can act like a regularizer, restricting how drastically consecutive layers can distort each other’s embeddings. This might reduce overfitting but also might hamper the model’s ability to compress or transform data.  
- **Spectral** constraints can similarly require that local and global features stay aligned, which might slow down training or require more steps but potentially yield better interpretability or compositional generalization.  

### 5.3 Limitations & Open Questions

- **Mathematical Rigor**: The code is a heuristic interpretation of exactness and spectral sequences. We are not computing cohomology in a rigorous sense.  
- **Computational Overhead**: Some modules (like those that do partial SVD or large gating) can be slow for big models.  
- **Empirical Performance**: Little real-world evidence suggests these methods outcompete standard Transformers for typical tasks. This is an open research area.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. CIRCUIT DETECTION & PRUNING EXPLAINED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We included a minimal approach to “circuit detection”:

1. **CriticalSequenceDetector**:  
   - Takes an activation (like the final representation from a layer).  
   - Measures its norm. If it’s above some threshold, we label it “critical.”  
   - A real system might do a more sophisticated analysis (like multi-sample gradient correlation, or rank-based sorting).  

2. **CircuitPreservationPruner**:  
   - Gathers parameter norms.  
   - If many are below a certain percentile, we zero them out.  
   - We do not guarantee that the pruned model remains stable. This is more of a conceptual demonstration.  

One might refine these ideas by analyzing cohomological invariants across multiple layers or by building more advanced layering logic that only prunes weights that do not contribute to the “image” subspace needed by the next layer’s “kernel.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Potential expansions**:

1. **Full Sheaf-Theoretic Implementation**:  
   - Instead of just referencing “exactness,” attempt to define a “sheaf” over tokens or attention heads, enforcing local consistency with global constraints.  

2. **Category-Theory–Inspired Architecture**:  
   - Expand from sequences to diagrams, then ensure compositional transformations preserve functorial properties.  

3. **Ergodic & Measure-Theoretic Approaches**:  
   - The conversation suggested measure-theoretic or ergodic theory might clarify how parameter updates explore the loss surface. Could be integrated with the “exactness” tracking.  

4. **Non-Commutative Geometry**:  
   - We briefly mentioned non-commutative geometry for parallel attention streams. Another frontier is to define a training approach that respects “parallel transport” or curvature constraints in representation spaces.  

5. **Distillation & Compression**:  
   - We have a small mention of compressing big models while preserving cohomological structure. In theory, you could do advanced knowledge distillation that ensures the “short exact sequences” remain valid in the smaller student.  

6. **Compositional Reasoning**:  
   - Possibly the biggest motivator for topological constraints is to see if the model can handle out-of-distribution compositional tasks better, by systematically preserving partial substructures.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **I get shape mismatch errors**  
   - Make sure your input dimension `dim` matches the modules’ internal dimension. E.g., `ToyCohomologicalModel` expects `[batch_size, seq_length, dim]`.  
   - If you see errors in the transitions or trackers, confirm that the dimension is consistent from one step to the next.

2. **Performance is slow**  
   - Some custom operations (like partial SVD or large gating layers) can be slow. You can comment them out or reduce the batch size.  
   - The code is not optimized for big GPU clusters.  

3. **Loss does not converge**  
   - The structural losses might be too heavy-handed. Try reducing their weights. Or train longer.  
   - Because everything is random, the model might not stabilize quickly.  

4. **Can I do real NLP tasks with this?**  
   - Potentially. You’d have to replace the random input with a tokenizer output, or adapt the `CohomologicalTransformer` to handle embeddings for text tokens.
